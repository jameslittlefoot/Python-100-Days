How do they resolve pull requests? Can you get a sense of how contributions are evaluated in this community? How is the community organized? How is the repository/project organized?

They solve pull request by accessing them by a first come and first serve basis. I can kind of get a sense but since this is mainly a smaller repository there isn't a lot to go on.
The community is organized mainly around smaller divisions probably just a singular person doing a task and pushing it in. This repository is organized by daily pushes which are marked and dated.
